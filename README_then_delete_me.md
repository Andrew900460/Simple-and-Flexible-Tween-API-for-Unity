You are free to put the Tween.cs file wherever you see fit.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this file, retrofit it to work for your project (even if it's not Unity).

See the example folder for a simple example script that shows you how to use it, there are also a bunch of other things that you can change to make the Tweening look different.

I made this script in celebration of our twitch stream reaching 50 followers (and getting twitch affiliate).
